Status: currently broken (syntax errors, incomplete sections)

Current goals:
- Test DeviceStream, and get it working. Bugs are expected.
    - Test allocator
    - Test statement evaluator
    - Test packing correctly
    - Test that device instructions get injected correctly
    - Test in working implementation
- Load a set of genomes and calculate a bare minimum `Feature` set (no xforms,
  no filters, no oversample)
- Get frames loaded for rendering
- Get IterThread running in device kernel
    - For now, implement as `PTXTest`
    - For each frame, loop for FUSE times, then loop through expected number of
      points for each CP. Keep a count of number of times looped, and number of
      stores that would be done. Verify against expected counts.


Things to do (rather severely incomplete):
- LaunchContext thread distribution based on generated code register count and
  shared memory size
- qlocal storage
    - Performance implications of different state spaces
    - Shared / cache projected usage and its effect on above
    - Implement qlocal storage, and hide the complexity
- The `Feature` class
    - Transform count and per-transform code layout
    - Filter size, oversample, final buffer size
- Palette storage
    - Performance implications of different state spaces
    - Performance and quality of 2D texture interpolation
- Buffer allocation, clearing, reading from device
- Preview window
    - When/how to sample?
    - OpenGL interop worth it?
    - Implement
- Implement xforms
- Shuffle
    - State space implications, you know the drill
    - Implement
    - Test effects on quality by masking off writes on all but one lane and
      boosting the sample density to compensate (muuuuuch later on)
